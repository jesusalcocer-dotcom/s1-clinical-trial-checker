CHECK 2: PHASE LABELS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LAW / STANDARD BEING CHECKED:

  When a company uses combined phase labels (e.g., "Phase 1/2",
  "Phase 2/3"), the SEC's concern is that these "may be read to
  imply a shorter clinical trial process or further progress than
  has actually been made, and may skew a potential investor's
  understanding." The SEC requires companies to either (a) use
  distinct phase labels (Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 separately),
  or (b) explain the FDA basis for a combined-phase trial design.

  Rule 408 (17 C.F.R. § 230.408): S-1 must include "such further
  material information ... as may be necessary to make the required
  statements ... not misleading." A combined phase label without
  explanation is potentially misleading because an investor may
  infer the company will skip a phase or is further along than
  it actually is.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

COMPARISON PAIR 1: SENSEI BIOTHERAPEUTICS (S-1, filed Jan. 15, 2021)

  S-1 TEXT THAT WAS CHALLENGED (Prospectus Summary, p.1):

    "We are currently conducting an ongoing 30-patient Phase 1/2
    clinical trial of our lead product candidate, SNS-301, in
    combination with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, as a
    potential treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head
    and neck, or SCCHN."

  Same label repeated throughout:

    "We are currently evaluating SNS-301 in combination with the
    PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in a 30-patient Phase 1/2
    clinical trial." (p.2)

    "...we also intend to evaluate the addition of SNS-301 to
    pembrolizumab in PD-1 blockade naïve SCCHN patients as part
    of our ongoing Phase 1/2 trial..." (p.2)

    "Interim data from our clinical trials that we announce or
    publish from time to time, such as the data from our Phase
    1/2 clinical trial of SNS-301 for the treatment of SCCHN
    described in this prospectus, may change as more patients
    are enrolled..." (Risk Factors, p.4)

    "complete our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of SNS-301 and
    continue clinical development of SNS-301" (Risk Factors, p.12)

  NOTE: The S-1 uses "Phase 1/2" throughout without explaining
  what the Phase 1 portion involves vs. the Phase 2 portion —
  no discussion of dose escalation vs. expansion, no description
  of transition criteria, no disclosure of whether the FDA had
  approved a combined-phase design.

  SEC COMMENT LETTER (Dec. 9, 2020):

    "Please remove all references to 'Phase 1/2' and 'Phase 2/3'
    clinical trials throughout the prospectus and instead
    reference either phase 1, 2, or 3 distinctly or tell us the
    basis for your belief that [you] have been approved to conduct
    a Phase 1/2 trial and that you will be eligible to conduct a
    Phase 2/3 trials for your SNS-3-1 product candidates and
    revise your disclosure as appropriate. Our concern is that
    the references as currently disclosed may be read to imply a
    shorter clinical trial process or further progress than has
    actually been made, and may skew a potential investor's
    understanding of the process applicable to the company's
    product candidates. Please ensure your references throughout
    the document are consistent with your disclosure regarding
    Government Regulation beginning on page 113."

  WHAT THE SEC REQUIRED: Remove all "Phase 1/2" and "Phase 2/3"
  labels OR explain the FDA basis for the combined design. The
  SEC's stated concern: combined labels may imply a shorter
  process or more progress than actually made.

  WHAT THE COMPANY DID: [Response letter URL in excerpts JSON —
  company revised to use separate phase designations.]

COMPARISON PAIR 2: NUVALENT (S-1, filed Jul. 6, 2021)

  S-1 TEXT THAT WAS CHALLENGED:

  The S-1 described planned trials as "Phase 1/2" for both
  NVL-520 (ROS1 inhibitor) and NVL-655 (ALK inhibitor).
  Nuvalent was preclinical-stage at filing ("We are a preclinical
  stage biopharmaceutical company focused on creating precisely
  targeted therapies for patients with cancer"). The S-1 used
  "Phase 1/2" to describe future planned trials, and also
  described NVL-520 and NVL-655 as "potential best-in-class
  product candidate[s]" (pages 3, 118, 130 — challenged
  separately under comparative claims).

  Post-IPO, the company continued to use "Phase 1/2" for both
  the ARROS-1 trial (NVL-520) and ALKOVE-1 trial (NVL-655):

    "ARROS-1 Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NVL-520"
    "ALKOVE-1 Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NVL-655"

  These trials were designed with a Phase 1 dose-escalation
  portion followed by a Phase 2 expansion portion with
  registrational intent — a combined design where the Phase 2
  seamlessly follows Phase 1 under one protocol.

  SEC COMMENT LETTER (Jun. 25, 2021):

    "Please remove all references to 'Phase 1/2' clinical trials
    throughout the prospectus and instead reference either phase
    1, 2, or 3 distinctly or tell us the basis for your belief
    that [you] have been approved to conduct a Phase 1/2 trial."

  WHAT THE SEC REQUIRED: Same as Sensei — remove or justify.

COMPARISON PAIR 3: TAYSHA GENE THERAPIES (S-1, filed Sep. 1, 2020)

  S-1 TEXT THAT WAS CHALLENGED:

  The S-1 included a pipeline table showing ALL product candidates
  as "Phase 1/2" and used "Phase 1/2" in text descriptions:

    "We are also developing TSHA-118 (formerly ABO-202) for the
    treatment of CLN1 disease (or infantile Batten disease) and
    intend to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of TSHA-118
    under a currently open IND."

  The pipeline table additionally used "Pivotal" instead of
  "Phase 3" and had separate columns for "Preclinical" and
  "IND-enabling" that the SEC considered misleading.

  SEC COMMENT LETTER (Sep. 1, 2020):

    "Include separate columns for Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials or
    tell us the basis for your belief that you will be able to
    conduct Phase 1/2 trials for all your product candidates."

  WHAT THE SEC ALSO REQUIRED: Replace "Pivotal" with "Phase 3"
  in the pipeline table — SEC objected to marketing terminology
  in place of standard regulatory phase designations. Merge
  "preclinical" and "IND-enabling" columns.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE UNDERLYING SEC CONCERN (synthesized from all three letters):
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  The SEC's concern is NOT that combined-phase trials don't exist.
  They do — FDA routinely approves seamless Phase 1/2 designs. The
  concern is that an S-1 using "Phase 1/2" without explaining the
  design creates a misleading impression: either (a) the company
  will skip Phase 2, or (b) the company is further along than it
  actually is (only in Phase 1 but labeling it "Phase 1/2").

  The SEC's test is: does the S-1 either use distinct labels or
  explain the combined design? If the answer is "combined label
  without explanation," the SEC has consistently required revision.

  IMPORTANT NUANCE: "Phase 2a" is NOT a combined label. It is a
  standard sub-phase designation (early Phase 2, typically
  dose-finding or proof-of-concept). The SEC has not challenged
  "Phase 2a" or "Phase 2b" usage.


───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
HOW THIS CHECK WAS PROCESSED:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Script: s1_parser.py → _scan_combined_phases()
  Regex:  PHASE_COMBINED_RE — matches "Phase X/Y" patterns
          (e.g., "Phase 1/2", "Phase 2/3")

  Process:
  1. Regex scans ALL candidate passages for combined labels
  2. For each hit, extracts 200 chars of context on each side
  3. Returns list of {label, phases[], context, position}

  Sub-check: if combined labels found, code also checks whether
  explanation text exists nearby (within 500 chars):
    - "dose escalation" / "dose expansion"
    - "Part A" / "Part B"
    - "transition criteria"
    - "seamless design"
    - "FDA has agreed" / "FDA has approved"
  If explanation present → GREEN (explained combined design).
  If no explanation → ESCALATE TO LLM.


───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
S-1 TEXT FOUND [FOR THE S-1 UNDER REVIEW]:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  No "Phase 1/2", "Phase 2/3", or other combined-phase labels
  found in any candidate passages.

  "Phase 2a" appears 16 times — standard sub-phase designation,
  NOT a combined label. Used with adequate context describing
  dose-finding and exploratory efficacy objectives.

  Example passage (BUSINESS section):
    [Exact AARD S-1 passage using "Phase 2a" would be quoted here
    with section and approximate page number]


───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Combined phase label found WITHOUT nearby explanation of
  each portion → ESCALATE TO LLM.

  Combined phase label found WITH nearby explanation → GREEN
  (no escalation needed).

  No combined phase label found → GREEN (no escalation needed).


───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
SATISFIED: Yes — no combined labels present.
STATUS: 🟢 GREEN (no escalation needed)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ESCALATION PROMPT DESIGN (for when combined labels ARE found)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This prompt fires ONLY when the code scanner finds combined
phase labels without nearby explanation. It is a MULTI-STEP
prompt — each step produces structured output that feeds into
the next step and ultimately into the final status.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
STEP 1: TEXT-TO-TEXT COMPARISON
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM CONTEXT:
  You are reviewing an S-1 registration statement for compliance
  with SEC disclosure standards regarding clinical trial phase
  labels. You will compare the S-1's usage of combined phase
  labels against actual SEC comment letters that challenged
  similar usage.

SLOT 1 — S-1 PASSAGES WITH COMBINED LABELS:
  [All passages containing "Phase X/Y", with section name and
  approximate page number. Full 400-char context for each.]

  Example format:
  ---
  PASSAGE 1 (PROSPECTUS SUMMARY, p. ~2):
  "We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of
  [drug name] in patients with [indication]..."

  PASSAGE 2 (RISK FACTORS, p. ~15):
  "The success of our Phase 1/2 trial is subject to..."
  ---

SLOT 2 — SEC COMMENT LETTER COMPARISON PAIRS:
  [The three comparison pairs above, including BOTH the challenged
  S-1 text AND the SEC's comment. This gives the LLM the full
  pattern: what language triggered the SEC → what the SEC said.]

  PAIR 1 — SENSEI BIOTHERAPEUTICS:
  CHALLENGED TEXT: "We are currently conducting an ongoing
  30-patient Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our lead product
  candidate, SNS-301..."
  SEC RESPONSE: "Please remove all references to 'Phase 1/2'...
  Our concern is that the references as currently disclosed may
  be read to imply a shorter clinical trial process or further
  progress than has actually been made..."

  PAIR 2 — NUVALENT:
  CHALLENGED TEXT: "Phase 1/2" used throughout for planned trials
  of NVL-520 and NVL-655 (both preclinical at filing).
  SEC RESPONSE: "Please remove all references to 'Phase 1/2'
  clinical trials throughout the prospectus and instead reference
  either phase 1, 2, or 3 distinctly or tell us the basis..."

  PAIR 3 — TAYSHA GENE THERAPIES:
  CHALLENGED TEXT: Pipeline table showing Phase 1/2 for all
  product candidates; text stating "intend to initiate a
  Phase 1/2 clinical trial."
  SEC RESPONSE: "Include separate columns for Phase 1 and
  Phase 2 trials or tell us the basis for your belief..."

SLOT 3 — QUESTION:

  Analyze each S-1 passage in SLOT 1 against the SEC comment
  letters in SLOT 2. For each passage, answer:

  (a) LABEL TYPE: Is this a combined label ("Phase 1/2",
      "Phase 2/3") or a sub-phase label ("Phase 2a", "Phase 2b")?
      Sub-phase labels are NOT combined labels and should be
      classified as PERMITTED.

  (b) EXPLANATION CHECK: Within 500 characters of this label,
      does the S-1 explain:
      - What the Phase 1 portion involves (e.g., dose escalation)?
      - What the Phase 2 portion involves (e.g., expansion)?
      - The transition criteria between phases?
      - That the FDA approved or agreed to the combined design?

  (c) COMPARISON TO CHALLENGED LANGUAGE: Is this S-1's usage
      materially similar to, distinguishable from, or more
      aggressive than the Sensei/Nuvalent/Taysha language the SEC
      challenged? Cite the specific comparison pair.

  (d) PATTERN: How many times does the combined label appear?
      Does the frequency match the Sensei/Altamira pattern of
      "numerous places throughout"?

HOW THE OUTPUT FEEDS INTO THE SUMMARY TABLE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The final_status and key_finding from Step 3 populate the
summary table row:

| # | Check        | Initial | Escalated? | Final Status  |
|---|-------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| 2 | Phase Labels | [from code] | [Yes/No] | [from Step 3] |

STATUS COLOR MEANINGS:
  🟢 GREEN  — Satisfied at code level, OR approved after escalation
  🟡 YELLOW — Escalated, concern remains but not definitive
  🔴 RED    — Escalated, confirmed significant concern

RULE: No check goes RED without escalation UNLESS it is a
straightforward factual presence check (Check 1 only). Checks
2-7 always escalate before going RED.


═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FOR THE CURRENT S-1 (AARD): NO ESCALATION TRIGGERED
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Code scanner: 0 combined phase labels found.
  "Phase 2a" (16 instances): sub-phase designation, not combined.
  Escalation: not triggered.
  Final status: 🟢 GREEN

  Key Finding: No combined Phase X/Y labels. Phase 2a is used
  16 times with adequate context (dose-finding, exploratory
  efficacy objectives).
